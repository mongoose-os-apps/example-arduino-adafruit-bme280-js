# BME280 sensor usage example (JavaScript)

## Overview

This app is a BME280 sensor usage usage example in JavaScript.

## How to install this app

- Install and start [mos tool](https://mongoose-os.com/software.html)
- Switch to the Project page, find and import this app, build and flash it:

Alternatively, you can build and flash this example from the command line:

```
### Build
$ git clone https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/example-arduino-adafruit-bme280-js.git && cd example-arduino-adafruit-bme280-js
$ mos build --platform esp32
$ mos flash

### Wait for Boot and then set I2C Pins
$ mos console
$ mos config-set i2c.scl_gpio=22 i2c.sda_gpio=23

### Verify I2C
$ mos config-get i2c
```

## Using this Example

For this example to work properly you must ensure your I2C or SPI configuration is correct.  You can check your device's current configuration using `mos config-get`, look for the "i2c" or "spi" section.  

```
$ mos config-get i2c
Using port /dev/ttyUSB1
{
  "debug": false,
  "enable": true,
  "freq": 100000,
  "scl_gpio": 22,
  "sda_gpio": 23
}
```

When your device boots, the output should look like the following, watch carefully for the "mgos_i2c_create" (or equivilent SPI) line from the boot up messages to ensure your pins were initialized correctly via the Web UI or `mos console`:

Please note that on ESP8266 and ESP32 the pins you choose to use for I2C aren't important, just ensure your configuration is on the pins you've selected.

For I2C, the Sensor Address is very important, the Adafruit BME280 uses address 0x77, many generic BME280's utilize 0x76.  If you are having trouble, try switching addresses or consult your datasheet.

It is well known that BME280's tend to self-warm and report higher than expected temperatures.  The tolerance of the BME280 tensor is +/-1C, however when added to heating it isn't uncommon to see temperatures as much as 1.8C higher than ambient.  You should add adjustments to your code after testing in the environment you will use the sensor using a reliable thermometer.  Please do not report excessive temps as a Mongoose bug.
